# PyTorch implementation of TRPO

This is a PyTorch implementation of ["Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477).

This is code mostly ported from [original implementation by John Schulman](https://github.com/joschu/modular_rl). In contrast to [another implementation of TRPO in PyTorch](https://github.com/mjacar/pytorch-trpo), this implementation uses exact Hessian-vector product instead of finite differences approximation.

## How to run

```bash
python main.py --env-name "Qube-100-v0"
```
